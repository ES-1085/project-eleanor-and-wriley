## 1. Introduction

In this project, we will use existing data about the seabirds breeding
on Great Duck Island to explore their ecologies and distributions. Much
of this data was collected for long-term monitoring or for student
projects that have been completed. We hope that by re-visiting some of
this data from a higher-level and data-focused perspective, we will be
able to tease out some new information about the island that has yet to
be discovered. We are particularly interested in exploring the spatial
distribution of the seabird colonies on GDI and how they have changed
over time.
