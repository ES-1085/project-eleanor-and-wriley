Exploring Long-Term Datasets from Great Duck Island
================
by Eleanor and Wriley

## Summary

Students have been collecting data on Great Duck Island since 2000.
## Methods/Data Collection



## Navigating the Project Folder

This README should be the first thing you see upon opening the folder. There are several sub-folders containing RMD and MD files. Each sub-folder should have its own data folder for the data that those files rely upon.

We mainly focused on two long-term monitoring projects: Tower Count and Colony Mapping. 

The `Data Cleaning Scripts` folder contains code that we wrote to clean up long-term data sheets and bind them into clean, master dataframes. 

`Tower Count Data` contains:
-`tower_count_data_cleaning.rmd` : the RMD file used to clean 20 years worth of tower count data and combine those files into one master data sheet
-`tower_count_data_cleaning_use_guide.md` : A markdown file that explains the functions used in the RMD file, meant to ease the process of adding future years' data
-`data` : a folder that contains the raw datasheets from 2000 - 2022, a data dictionary for those files, and the clean csv file output by the data cleaning rmd file.

The `Cleaning Nest Counts and Mapping Data` folder contains code that we wrote to 


The `proposal` folder contains our original proposal for the project, including a data folder that the proposal.rmd file relies on, a dictionary for that data folder, and the exploratory visuals we created for our proposal.

The `presentation` folder contains code and files used to build our presentation in Google Slides, which can be accessed here:  , it contains:

-`data`: a data folder for the clean data files that the presentation.rmd file draws upon. A data dictionary is included.
-`presentation.rmd`:  the RMD file that we used to create our presentation graphics 
-`presentation.md` : a knit markdown version of our presentation figures


The `towercount_shinyapp` folder contains necessary files for the Tower Count shiny app, which can be found here: https://udppk1-eleanor-gnam.shinyapps.io/towerDRAFT/. It contains a data folder for the data file that the app draws upon, a dictionary for that datafolder, and a README with instructions on how to use and update the app.
